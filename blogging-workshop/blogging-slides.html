# 2. Brief thoughts on expertise
- everyone has some knowledge that other people need
- beginners are the BEST people to explain things to other beginners
- don't worry if you can't come up with something super technical right now, non-technical stuff is very important and the more technical stuff will come with time
  Credibility related to expertise
  Coherence
  Specificity
  Timing
  Matter of fact delivery
  Jargon

# 3. Types of Topics:
  How to do this, fix this
    especially good if you couldn't find a good tutorial for something - create your own!

  Intro to a technology
  Process
  Success Story
  Philosophy
Cheat sheet: A hack I used to accomplish X
  Last bug I fixed
  My favorite tool/technique/module/etc.
  Bad advice for beginners
  Most painful tool to use
  Something I thought would be useful but didn't work

# 9. Tips for editing
  Cut 20% (this isn't a college essay, no word minimums; shorter is often sweeter)
  Pull out main points and reorganize
    Listicle?
    How-to?
  Humanize - add the story
